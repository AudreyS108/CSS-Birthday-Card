# CSS-Animated Birthday Card
This project is called CSS Birthday Card.   
It is a project dedicated to one of my best friends, and is also my second submission for the 2025 Athena Award.  
Note that in this repository, I removed the name of the receiver and also the message inside the card as I would prefer to keep both of those private! (I hope that is understandable! ^^)

What It Is:
-
This birthday card project (made using the coding languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript) serves as a special gift, and contains many technical and aesthetic elements, which are:
* An animation of an opening and closing birthday card (using CSS transitions)
* A birthday cake created purely from CSS code and HTML divs
* A cute embedded "Happy Birthday" GIF inside the birthday card
* A technical function to "blow out" the birthday candles on the CSS cake when the user clicks on the candle flame (Made using JavaScript and HTML)
* A birthday message inside the card (removed in this repository for the purpose of privacy and personal reasons.)

Why Did I Make This Project?
-
This was an idea I had long before I had even known about the Athena Award, around sometime during April-May. My friend, who I had dedicated this project to, was the person who taught me how to code in HTML and CSS in the first place. I wanted to surprise her on her birthday by creating a digital HTML & CSS card, which I hoped would showcase the skills I had learned from her, and also my dedication and thankfulness to her as a friend! At the time though, I wasn't particularly sure of my coding abilities and doubted myself, so I didn't do it initially. However, after I had developed my coding skills more, I felt more confident that I could complete this birthday card project, and so I did!

This project was made by using the coding languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used the code editor VS Code to create this project.
* HTML: Used for the basic structure of the website, as well as also being used to add images, buttons and (lots of) divs.
* CSS: The *primary* code language used for this project. It's responsible for the design of the cake, card, background and animations
* JS: I used it for button functions, such as for the blowing of the candles and the disable/enable buttons.
* As a special addition, I added my friend's favourite things: the colour pale green, lemon cake, and the font Outfit!
**add the part with the surprise anim later**

I was faced with multiple challenges throughout the making of this project.
* Challenge 1: I wanted to create a function for the candle flame to disappear (to mimic the blowing of the candles). To do this I had to link JavaScript on my website, a language whcih I wasn't too familiar with at the time. After learning with some resources online (and using some of my own prior knowledge and intuition) I managed to create a function where the candle (button) would disappear after being clicked.
* Challenge 2: After creating the "blow out the candles" function and finishing the card animations, I realised I couldn't even tap the buttons because of the animations playing :( In order to fix this, I added a "Disable Animations" button and "Enable Animations" button to fix this. Within these buttons I added functions so that when the "Disable Animations" was pressed, the JS would add a class of "noanim", stopping the anim. For the "Enable Animations" button, I did the opposite and removed the "noanim" class. 
* **ADD MORE LATER**

I think being able to create this project has given me a boost in confidence, and I also further developed my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills along the way, which I'm extremely happy about. :)
