# CSS-Animated Birthday Card
This project is called CSS Birthday Card.   
It is a project dedicated to one of my best friends, and is also my second submission for the 2025 Athena Award.  
Note that in this repository, I removed the name of the receiver and also the message inside the card as I would prefer to keep both of those private! (I hope that is understandable! ^^)

What It Is:
-
This birthday card project (made using the coding languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript) serves as a special gift, and contains many technical and aesthetic elements, which are:
* An animation of an opening and closing birthday card (using CSS transitions)
* A birthday cake created purely from CSS code and HTML divs
* A cute embedded "Happy Birthday" GIF inside the birthday card
* A technical function to "blow out" the birthday candles on the CSS cake when the user clicks on the candle flame (Made using JavaScript and HTML)
* A birthday message inside the card (removed in this repository for the purpose of privacy and personal reasons.)

Why Did I Make This Project?
-
This was an idea I had long before I had even known about the Athena Award, around sometime during April-May. My friend, who I had dedicated this project to, was the person who taught me how to code in HTML and CSS in the first place. I wanted to surprise her on her birthday by creating a digital HTML & CSS card, which I hoped would showcase the skills I had learned from her, and also my dedication and thankfulness to her as a friend! At the time though, I wasn't particularly sure of my coding abilities and doubted myself, so I didn't do it initially. However, after I had developed my coding skills more, I felt more confident that I could complete this birthday card project, and so I did! I think being able to create this project has given me a boost in confidence, and I also further developed my HTML, CSS and javaScript skills along the way, which I'm extremely happy about. :D
